        Just like your human children will always be your babies, 
        <em>your dog will always be your puppy</em>. Unfortunately, 
        for some that’s all too real when they have a dog that, 
        even when he’s full-grown still carries on with typically 
        “puppy-like” destructive tendencies. 
        You may expect a puppy to destroy his fluffy bed a time or two, 
        but for a bigger dog, his destruction can be so much more damaging to your home than just his bed. 
        If you can give him a bed that is indestructible, then you may be able to discourage the behavior before it spreads. 
        You may also want to make sure there isn’t something bigger at play; separation anxiety, for example, 
        is a very common motivation for your dog’s destructive behaviors, and while leaving him is unavoidable, 
        buying a new bed won’t solve the root of his problems, of course. 
        Talk to your vet and make sure you’re not just slipping a band-aide on a bigger problem to be sure.

        We reviewed dozens of indestructible dog beds to identify the best of the best. 
        We looked for the elevated beds that are chew-proof and luxurious beds that are waterproof (for his struggling potty habits). 
        We found nesting beds to keep him cozy as well as the orthopedic beds that will help keep your older dogs with sore joints more comfortable.
